- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?



the class i created was a monster class which implemented the methods from the contract interface. the monster class creates different monsters who can perform different actions.
the monsters can grab items, but only one at a time. if a monster tries to grab something else it will not be able to unless it drops a previous item which it can also do. if holding an item, the monster can use it. monsters can also examine items and share what they think of them. they can also grow and shrink, either by a default amount or a user-entered amount. all monsters can walk and some can also fly -- they fly by default unless "false" is entered as an attibute when constructing the monster. monsters also rest by going to sleep for a certain amount of time which can be indicated in the parameter of the rest method. i also added an additional 'scare' method which takes in a boolean for whether or not the monster is nice. the scare method allows monsters to scare people, but only if they are not nice. what worked for this project was implementing the methods from the interface with the proper parameters and then overloading these methods to add new parameters. this helped with making my method a bit more precise to what i might want to do with them. something i struggled with was figuring out what to do with some of the methods, for example, i wasn't sure what to do with the parameters for the fly method since the return was a boolean, but eventually decided to utilise them in the print statement. advice i would give to future students would be to play around with and have fun with building your class. try to make them a bit more complex in cool ways if you can.
